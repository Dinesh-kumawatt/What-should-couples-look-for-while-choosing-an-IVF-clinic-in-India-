# What-should-couples-look-for-while-choosing-an-IVF-clinic-in-India-

Donâ€™t just go by ads. Choosing the right clinic needs careful thinking. Look for:

Success rates (by age group, not overall)

In-house lab & OT

Trained embryologist

Honest, caring doctors

Transparency in pricing

Counseling & aftercare

Talk to the doctor, ask your doubts, and see if you feel heard. A good clinic explains everything and doesnâ€™t rush you into IVF. Trinity IVF is known for this balanced approach.

Check reviews from real people, ask about how many cycles are usually needed, and whether they guide you even if the first cycle fails.
